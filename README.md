# amazon-cart-bug-challenge

## Description
### Objective
The objective of this exercise is to evaluate the candidates ability to analyze, debug and test a typical scenario that he/she will encounter on a daily basis. 

### Introduction
As part of the checkout experience, Amazon is running a promotions campaign. For given items that a user has on a cart at checkout time, a discount is applied if a promotion for that item exists. 

Several promotions might exist for the same item. In the case that an item has more than one promotion, the smallest discount is the one that has to be applied. 

The cart at checkout time consists of several items. One cart can potentially have repeated items. The engineering checkout division at Amazon came with an algorithm to calculate a total price of the checkout.

After rolling out this experiment, several clients report that they have not been charged the correct amount.
